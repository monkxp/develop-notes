  "description": "Several years ago, I encountered a project where the mobile version suffered from slow load times. To address this, we initiated a research project aimed at improving performance. Our initial efforts involved caching the JavaScript bundle in the browser and splitting it into multiple files. As a next step, we explored server-side rendering (SSR) to see if it could further enhance performance. In this section, I'll review our findings regarding server-side rendering technologies.",
